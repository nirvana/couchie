The Truly Free License (sm)
======================
Version 0.1.1 (provisional)

This Software is Copyright © 2013 by The Nirvana Organization • http://nirvana.io   
All rights reserved.

Free software should be truly free. The GPL and its derivatives infringe
upon the freedoms of the licensee by forcing distribution of source code
with distribution of binaries. Further they restrict freedoms by forcing the 
re-licensing of free software under their restrictive license. 

Many advocates of the GPL are confused about their rights under 
permissive licenses and consequently violate them by incorporating 
free code in deriviative works under viral licenses, taking away freedom.

This license is designed to prevent its subject from being re-licensed 
under anti-business, anti-freedom licenses such as the GPL.

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"),
to deal in the Software including, without other limitation, the rights to
use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell 
copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is 
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

1. No part of the Software may be included in derivative works that are 
distributed under any of the following types of licenses:

	A. Copyleft restricted licenses, including, but not limited to the GPL, GPL2, or GPL3. 

	B. Any license that requires source code to be distributed with derivatives

	C. Any license that requires relicensing of derivative works under a license 
		that would not comply with these terms.   

2. The above copyright notice, this permission notice, including the disclaimer
below shall be included in all copies or portions of the Software.

Yes, I know this is a bit overwrought, but the integrity of the license is protected by
not having a million derivatives running around, sowing confusion wherever they go.
